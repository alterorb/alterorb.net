## About

AlterOrb is a project that aims to emulate all the original features that were available in the original FunOrb games.
It solely focuses on the single-player experience that were available in the original games.

## Downloading the Launcher

Prebuilt binaries for Windows and Debian based linux systems are available at the GitHub releases page.

If you're going to use the cross platform version (the jar file), make sure you have at least Java 17 installed, you can
download Java from the [Adoptium Project site](https://adoptium.net/).

Download the latest launcher from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alterorb/launcher/releases).

## Creating an account

You create an account by using the signup form available inside the games.

## Getting help

If you’re having any trouble downloading or using the launcher you can ask for help in the following channels:

* [FunOrb Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/MGfDrDf) server
* [FunOrb Central Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/a4qUynM) server

## Compatibility List

A game with **full** support signifies that all original features are available, including login, HiScores, Achievements
and level progression.

A game with **no-mp** support signifies login, HiScores, Achievements and level progression are available but the
multiplayer lobbies are disabled.

A game with **basic** support signifies that the game is launchable but no other features currently work.
